            <h2>Before You Call</h2>
            <p>Prior to calling us about a leak, please perform the following 3 tests:</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Place a piece of tape halfway up the skimmer and fill the pool so the water is at the base of the tape.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Before each step, ensure the water level is at the original starting point for proper comparison.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Run your pool for 24 hours with the pump on. Measure any water loss in inches.</li>
                <li>Run your pool for 24 hours with the pump off. Measure any water loss in inches.</li>
                <li>Plug your pool skimmer and jets using winter plugs (do not lower the water level)
                    and leave your pump off for 24 hours. Measure loss in inches. This last 
                    test is to determine if the leak is in the shell of the pool.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">Please measure the results in inches and use photographic evidence to back it up (before and after pictures of each test). You can text the results to 416-282-0999</p>
