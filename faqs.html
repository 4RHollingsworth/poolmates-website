                <p>
                    The nature of our work means each job is different, and the time required at each site can vary. 
                    To ensure we deliver the best service to all of our customers, we operate within a service window of 
                    9:30 AM to 5:00 PM on the day of your scheduled service. Occasionally, we may arrive a little earlier 
                    or possibly a little later if previous calls take longer than expected. We do not call or text prior to 
                    arrival, but we will notify you if we are unable to make the scheduled call. Thank you for your understanding!
                </p>

            <button class="faq-accordion">My pool is green. Can you clean it in one visit?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    Green pools generally cannot be cleared in a single visit. 
                    The number of visits and the amount of chemicals required 
                    vary based on the individual condition of the pool and how 
                    quickly it responds to treatment.

            <button class="faq-accordion">How often should I change the sand in my filter?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Filter sand typically outlasts the filter itself and does not need to be replaced during the filter's lifespan.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="faq-accordion">My pool has a safety cover. Will it overflow over the winter?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    Safety cover pools, when properly winterized and lowered to the correct water levels, 
                    generally do not overflow in the winter, even if the water level appears high.

            <button class="faq-accordion">Do you sell liquid chlorine?</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>
                    We continue to offer liquid chlorine for sale. Our tanks are refilled at least twice weekly 
                    throughout the high summer season.<br>Please note that chlorine tested directly from the take-home 
                    container will show as white on test strips because the concentration is significantly higher than 
                    what standard test strips are designed to measure. This will change once it mixes with water in your pool. 
                    If your chlorine level was at zero, the chlorine will enter the pool, do its job, and burn out, potentially leaving no residual chlorine after that dosage.
