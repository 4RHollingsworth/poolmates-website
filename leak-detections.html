            <h2>Before You Call</h2>
            <p>
                To help us better understand the source of your pool's leak, please complete the following 3 tests and document your results:
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">
                Step 1: Place a piece of tape halfway up the skimmer and fill the pool so the water is at the base of the tape
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">
                Step 2: Before each test, ensure the water level is at the original starting point for accurate comparison
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Run your pool for 24 hours with the pump <span style="font-weight: bold;">on</span>. Use a ruler to measure water loss in inches
                </li>
                <li>
                    Leave your pool off for 24 hours with the pump <span style="font-weight: bold;">off</span>. Again, measure the water loss in inches
                </li>
                <li>
                    Plug your pool skimmer and jets using winter plugs, without lowering the water level, and keep the pump off for 24 hours. Measure the water loss in inches 
                    <br><em>(This step determines if the leak is in the pool's shell.)</em>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">
                Please submit your results (in inches) along with before and after photos of each test by texting them to 
                <a href="tel:4162820999">(416) 282-0999</a>.

            <h2>"What's Included?"</h2>
            <p>
                Based on your findings, our team will use specialized techniques to identify the source of the leak:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pressure Testing:</strong> We inspect your pool’s plumbing lines using advanced equipment to locate leaks in underground or hidden pipework.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Shell Inspection:</strong> If the leak is suspected to be in the pool’s structure, we may use a certified diver to perform a hands-on inspection of the pool shell for cracks, damage, or weak spots.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">
                *Please note: Our leak detections are designed to identify the most significant leaks in your pool first. Secondary or minor leaks may require additional investigation.*
